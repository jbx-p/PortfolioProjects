Covid 19 Data Exploration 

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
In this project we will be using SQL to do some Data Exploration on the Covid data, 
-- Overview:
A. Calculations:
  
  
  - We will be calculating the Total Cases vs Total Deaths (shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country)
  - Total Cases vs Population ( Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid)
  - Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
  - Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

    
B. BREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT

  -  Showing contintents with the highest death count per population


C. GLOBAL NUMBERS

  - Total Population vs Vaccinations (Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine)
  - Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
  - Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
