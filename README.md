Covid 19 Data Exploration 

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
In this project we will be using SQL to do some Data Exploration on the Covid data, 
-- Overview:
A. Calculations:
  1. We will be calculating the Total Cases vs Total Deaths (shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country)
  2. Total Cases vs Population ( Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid)
  3. Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
  4. Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
B. BREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT
  -  Showing contintents with the highest death count per population
C. GLOBAL NUMBERS
  - Total Population vs Vaccinations (Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine)
  - Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
  - Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
